description: eHive is a web-based collection cataloguing system. Our system is used
  worldwide by hundreds of museums, societies and private collectors to catalogue
  objects, store images, manage acquisition information and publish their collections
  online. eHive can be accessed from any computer or device running a web browser,
  including PCs, Mac and mobiles. We take care of hosting and backing up your data,
  so your collection information is both secure and readily accessible. We also perform
  all of the system upgrades so any enhancements to eHive are made immediately available
  to you.
